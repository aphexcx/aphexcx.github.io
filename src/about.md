## About
Hi, I'm Afik (rhymes with `seek`)! I'm an SF-based builder and until recently, co-founded [Fairbrook AI](https://fairbrook.ai). Before that, I co-founded [Codeflash](https://codeflash.ai) and was an early employee at [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai).

Outside of computers (or rather, in concert with them), I am also a [DJ and artist](https://www.instagram.com/aphexcx/), having built many interactive art installations with tens of thousands of LEDs.

I'm currently exploring areas for my next project, so if you'd like to work together, [get in touch](#contact):)


## Interests
- Reinforcement learning, particularly the [big world hypothesis](https://khurramjaved.com/the_big_world_hypothesis.html)
- Code AGI will be the first AGI we achieve and [capture 80% of the value of AGI](https://www.swyx.io/cognition#short-code-timelines-long-agi-timelines)

## Non-obvious discoveries that have made a profound difference in my life

- The [Jaw Epidemic](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2020/07/toll-shrinking-jaws-human-health) is at the root of many of chronic "diseases of civilization"
- Luck is [created](https://www.swyx.io/create-luck)
