## About
Hi, I'm Afik (rhymes with `seek`)! I'm an SF-based builder and until recently, co-founded [Fairbrook AI](https://fairbrook.ai). Before that, I co-founded [Codeflash](https://codeflash.ai) and was an early employee at [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai).

Outside of computers (or rather, in concert with them), I am also a [DJ, music producer & artist](https://www.instagram.com/aphexcx/), and have worked on several large interactive art installations with tens of thousands of LEDs.

I'm currently exploring areas for my next project, so if you'd like to work together, [get in touch](#contact):)


## Problems I'm currently interested in
- Reinforcement learning, particularly the [big world hypothesis](https://khurramjaved.com/the_big_world_hypothesis.html)
- Code AGI will be the first AGI we achieve, [capturing 80% of the value of AGI](https://www.swyx.io/cognition#short-code-timelines-long-agi-timelines)
- Voice agents having conversations is nontrivial mainly because [turn-detection is non-trivial](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/smart-turn)
- In this decade, computers will be better than humans at [finding proofs of mathematical theorems](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_buzzard.pdf)

## Non-obvious discoveries that have made a profound difference in my life
- The [Jaw Epidemic](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2020/07/toll-shrinking-jaws-human-health) is at the root of many of chronic "diseases of civilization"
- Luck is [created](https://www.swyx.io/create-luck)
- Sleep is a [skill](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/blogs/news/how-i-fixed-my-terrible-sleep)
