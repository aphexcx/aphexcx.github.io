## About
Hi, I'm **Afik**! (/ɑˈfiːk/; *rhymes with "seek"*)
- Most recently co-founder & CTO [Fairbrook AI](https://fairbrook.ai) 
- Co-founded [Codeflash](https://codeflash.ai) 
- Worked at [Morph Labs](morph.so) 
- Early technical staff at [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) 

Currently open to research engineering roles in SF (in-person/hybrid) - <a href="mailto:&#97;&#112;&#104;&#101;&#120;&#64;&#97;&#112;&#104;&#101;&#120;&#46;&#99;&#120;">let's work together</a>

## Problems I'm currently interested in
- Reinforcement learning, particularly the [big world hypothesis](https://khurramjaved.com/the_big_world_hypothesis.html)
- Code AGI will be the first AGI we achieve, [capturing 80% of the value of AGI](https://www.swyx.io/cognition#short-code-timelines-long-agi-timelines)
- Voice agents having conversations is nontrivial mainly because [turn-detection is non-trivial](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/smart-turn)
- In this decade, computers will be better than humans at [finding proofs of mathematical theorems](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_buzzard.pdf)

## Non-obvious discoveries that have made a profound difference in my life
- The [Jaw Epidemic](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2020/07/toll-shrinking-jaws-human-health) is at the root of many of chronic "diseases of civilization"
- Luck is [created](https://www.swyx.io/create-luck)
- Sleep is a [skill](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/blogs/news/how-i-fixed-my-terrible-sleep)
- You are the average of the top 5 people you spend the most time with
- Lying and withholding is [the major source of all human stress and suffering](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Honesty-Transform-Telling-Truth/dp/0440507545)
- All problems are [interpersonal relationship problems](https://www.amazon.com/The-Courage-to-Be-Disliked-audiobook/dp/B07BRPW98K/)

## Art & Music
Outside of computers (or rather, in concert with them), I am also a [dj, music producer & artist](https://www.instagram.com/aphexcx/), and have worked on several large interactive art installations with tens of thousands of LEDs. I've taken many of these to [Burning Man](https://burningman.org/), where I'm one of the leads of the [BAAAHS art car](https://baaahs.org/) and volunteer as a [Black Rock Ranger](https://rangers.burningman.org/).
