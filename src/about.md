## About

Hi, I'm Afik (rhymes with `seek`)! I'm an SF-based builder and until recently, have been working on [Fairbrook AI](https://fairbrook.ai). Before that, I co-founded [Codeflash](https://codeflash.ai) and was an early employee at [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai).

I'm currently exploring areas for my next project, so if you'd like to work together, [get in touch](#contact):)

## Things I'm interested in
- Reinforcement Learning, particularly the [big world hypothesis](https://khurramjaved.com/the_big_world_hypothesis.html)
- Code AGI will be the first AGI we achieve and [capture 80% of the value of AGI](https://www.swyx.io/cognition#short-code-timelines-long-agi-timelines)
- 

I've spent more than a decade shipping highâ€‘impact features at companies like TikTok, Airbnb and Postmates, mentoring engineers and designing robust mobile architectures. Outside of work I build interactive art installations with tens of thousands of LEDs and experiment with large language models to see what's possible.
