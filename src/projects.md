<h3>Wave</h3>
<p>At <strong>Fairbrook AI</strong> I'm building <em>Wave</em>, a social voice app that merges live chat, text and recorded voice so you never have to schedule calls. Chatlines are always on and friends can drop in whenever.</p>

<h3>Codeflash</h3>
<p>Co‑founded <strong>Codeflash</strong> to build AI agents that automatically optimize Python code, search for the fastest implementation via benchmarking and deliver performance gains while verifying correctness.</p>

<h3>Event Horizon</h3>
<p>Part of the crew building a three‑story‑tall, audio‑reactive LED kinetic sculpture with five concentric rings spinning 30 ft in the air. Covered by over a mile of LEDs, it pulses to music and creates an immersive dance floor.</p>

<h3>SheepGPT</h3>
<p>I turned my mutant art car into a talking sheep using <em>Llama‑2 70B</em>. The on‑board computer generates quirky responses to burners in real time and speaks them through a glowing LED speech bubble.</p>

<h3>LED Totem</h3>
<p>A metre‑long Bluetooth‑controlled totem with 840 RGB LEDs. I built the PCB, firmware and Android app from scratch to send animations wirelessly at festivals and raves.</p>
